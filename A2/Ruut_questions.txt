Make sure the program is fairly well optimized in sequential mode (compiler flags!). 
If it runs badly on one core, things will go worse. Here's what you should ask yourself:

- Did you use Amdahl’s Law to estimate the speedup you could expect?
- Did you identify where you’re spending most of your time?
- Did you avoid parallelizing the innermost loops?
- Did you minimize the number of parallel regions?
- Did you at least use the nowait clause to minimize the use of barriers?
- Do all threads roughly perform the same amount of work?
- Did you maximize the use of private data?
- Did you take into account that you’re using a cc-NUMA system?
- Could there be false sharing affecting your performance?
