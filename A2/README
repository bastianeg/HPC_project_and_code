The Poisson problem in 3D
-------------------------

The files provided here are meant as a starting point for your second
assignment in the DTU course 02614.  

Makefile	- the project Makefile
main.c		- template for the main() method 
alloc3d.c	- memory allocation for 3d arrays
gauss_seidel.c  - a placeholder for the Gauss-Seidel iterator subroutine
jacobi.c	- a placeholder for the Jacobi iterator subroutine
print.c	        - some helper functions for dumping the grid to disk

In main.c, you can find a suggestion for reasonable program structure,
and it shows how to allocate 3d arrays, as well as how to dump data to
the disk.  You will need to write code for the two iterators, the data
initialization, etc.

The print.c source contains two subroutines:
    void print_binary(char *fname, int n, double ***u);
    void print_vtk(const char *fname, int n, double ***u);
The first one dumps the whole grid in binary format, the print_vtk()
adds some additional header information, that will allow to open the
file in ParaView.


How to use ParaView
-------------------
1) To open ParaView under ThinLinc, do the following: 

* either copy the file ParaViewVGL.desktop from this folder into your 
Desktop folder:
    cp ParaViewVGL.desktop ~/Desktop

* or in the ThinLinc session, right click on the desktop background,
choose 'Create Launcher' and fill in the text fields with he following
information:
    + Name: ParaViewVGL
    + Command: /apps/dcc/thinlinc/bin/paraviewvgl
and then click the 'Create' button.  This will place an icon on your
Desktop.  

The first time you click on the ParaViewVGL icon, you will get a
warning: just click 'Mark Executable', and ParaView should start up.

In ParaView, you can open the .vtk file created by your program.
After you have opened the file, you need to click on the green 'Apply'
button (to the left), and then you can choose a visualization
(Outline), e.g.  'Slice' or 'Volume'.
